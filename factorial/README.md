# ðŸ§® Factorial Algorithm

The **Factorial Algorithm** calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer **n**, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to **n**. The factorial of **n** is denoted as **n!**.

## ðŸ”¢ How it works:
The algorithm multiplies all integers from **n** down to **1**. For example, the factorial of **5** is calculated as:
**5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120**.

### Example:
For **n = 4**, the factorial calculation would be:
**4! = 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 24**.

## ðŸ“‰ Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the **Factorial Algorithm** is **O(n)**, as it requires **n** multiplicative operations to compute the factorial.

### ðŸ“Š Summary:
- **Factorial Algorithm ðŸ§®**: A basic but essential algorithm for computing factorials, with a time complexity of **O(n)**.
- **Best for**: Simple mathematical computations, especially when dealing with combinations, permutations, or recursive functions.
