# 🔍 Sequential Search Algorithm

The **Sequential Search** algorithm is one of the simplest ways to search for a target element within a list. It involves checking each element one by one from the beginning until a match is found or the entire list is exhausted.

## 🚶‍♂️ How it works:
The algorithm sequentially iterates through the list, comparing each element with the target value. If a match is found, the position of the element is returned. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns an indication that the element isn't present.

### Example:
Imagine you are looking for a specific book title in a list of books. The algorithm starts at the first title, checks if it matches, then moves to the next, and continues until it finds the title or reaches the end of the list.

## 🕒 Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the **Sequential Search** algorithm is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the list. In the worst case, it may need to check every element.

### 📊 Summary:
- **Sequential Search 🚶‍♂️**: Simple to implement, but may be slow for large lists with a time complexity of **O(n)**.
- **Best for**: Small lists or when the data is unsorted.
